# Hyperbolic-Paint

This youtube tutorial gave me a lot of help when building the design and function of the toolbars:

I used W3 schools tooltips page for the toolbar as well: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_tooltip.asp

Bugs to fix:

- When translating and axis of translation is dragged and becomes a diameter, weird stuff happens.

To do:

- (Optional) Repackage center of rotation and axis of translation for organizational purposes and DRY

Next steps:

- Add free drawing tool

- Make everything mobile friendly
