# Hyperbolic-Paint

This youtube tutorial gave me a lot of help when building the design and function of the toolbars:

I used W3 schools tooltips page for the toolbar as well: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_tooltip.asp

Bugs to fix:

- Fill colors not working

To do:

- Style the Controls section. In particular, make the play and pause button one button that changes what it says from play to pause. Then center it, and maybe make it bigger?

Next steps:

- Add free drawing tool

- Add ability to click and drag the hyperbolic plane itself, i.e., when the plane is clicked and dragged, all shapes should move.

- Make everything mobile friendly
