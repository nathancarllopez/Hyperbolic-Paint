# Hyperbolic-Paint

This youtube tutorial gave me a lot of help when building the design and function of the toolbars:

I used W3 schools tooltips page for the toolbar as well: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_tooltip.asp

bugs to fix:
- Adjusting the anchor size and then dragging causes the anchor size to reset. Additionally, if the anchor size is made sufficiently big and the line is then dragged, you can make everything on the canvas disappear by making the anchor size sufficiently small.

- Opening/closing dev tools causes the coordinates of the mouse cursor appear in the wrong place. Refreshing fixes the issue

- Having lines be different colors is not working.

- Line segments switch to drawing in the wrong orientation when one anchor is dragged around the other

To do:

- Add undo functionality

- Add tool tips to explain how each tool works

- Create introductory text (maybe in a collapsible section, or off to the left side?)
